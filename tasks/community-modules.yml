  # About sed:
  # - option `-r` switches to standard perl regexp, instead of GNU ones. Similar to `egrep` or `grep -E`
  # - option `-n` combined with flag `/p` prints "nothing" except the result of the script. Therefore, unmatching lines are hidden, and matching lines are shown after processed.
  # - capturing groups `(something)` can be referenced inside the matching part or at the replacing part with \1, \2, in order of appearence.
